# FreeCodeCamp Projects

This is my repo for holding all fcc projects, so far from the Machine Learning and Data Visualization modules with d3.js. 

## Dependencies for Machine Learning
* Tensorflow >= 2.x
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be be installed with pip or the code can be directly from the Google Colab link. 
Colab is a cloud hosted version of IPython Jupyter notebooks used for development. 

```bash
pip install tensorflow 
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```
